            <p>“The brain has two hemispheres” she says, “one ancient or archaic, which governs our emotions and instincts, the other younger, which governs our capacity to reason. Today the archaic brain tends to dominate. It is the cause of all the tragedies that happen like the Shoah (the Holocaust) and it is putting an end to humanity today. It was the part of our brains which got us down from the trees, but it is the cause of all the disasters and the cause of the great danger to our planet today. It is taking the human race toward extinction. The end is already at hand.”</p>

            Rita Levi-Montalcini was born in Italy in 1909 and died in 2012 at the age of 103.  She is best know for her work, along with that of colleague Stanley Cohen for discovering Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a pivotal piece of research in the quest to understand how cells survive and proliferate, and for which research they were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1986.  She was also one of the early scientists pointing to the importance of mast cells in understanding human pathology.

            In 1930, Levi-Montalcini enrolled the University of Turin Medical School in Italy and remained, after earning her degree, as a research assistant until 1938, when Benito Mussolini instituted a law barring Jews from holding university positions. Nevertheless, during this period, Levi-Montalcini persisted in her research, setting up a lab in her families home to continue her work.
