<h1>Block Elements</h1>
<h2>The kind of elements that always take up the whole line</h2>

<h1>Side note:<h1>
<h2>html ignores white space (see below in this code)</h2>

<h1>Paragraph</h1>

<p>
    This is another tag that can be used to separate a paragraph from the headings and write better looking copy in yet a smaller font.
</p>

<h1>Inline Elements</h1>
<p>
    These are elements that are displayed <em>in line</em> with the rest of the text, such as the em for emphasis.
</p>
This is an example of a "nested" element, in which one exists within the other.  You can also say they are parent and child elements.  You typically can only nest an inline element inside a block element and not the other way around (with one exception).

Why did that just default to a paragraph when I didn't give any tags at all? Remember to ask this in the class discussion.
